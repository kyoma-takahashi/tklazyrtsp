On cmd on Communication host,

(communicator <results_feeder URL> | tee.exe log) 3>&2 2>&1 1>&3 \
| tee2process.rb "source_feeder <source_receptor address and port>" \
| decoder \
> source_dump 2> log

tee.exe is in msys. Alternative: tee.bat in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10711839/using-a-custom-tee-command-for-bat-file/10719322#10719322
tee2process.rb "..." cannot be replaced by bash -c "tee >(source_feeder ...)"

On cmd on Calculation host,

source_receptor <listen port> <source_feeder address> \
| decoder \
| calculator \
| tee2process.rb "results_feeder <listen port>" \
> results_dump 2> log

tee2process.rb "..." cannot be replaced by tee >(results_feeder ...) even on msys.
bash: cannot make pipe for process substitution: Function not implemented

To feed results to communicator, there are some alternative
implementations. It depends on communicator capability and
performance.

Alternatively,

  Communication: communicator <listen port> <results_feeder address>
    Calculation: results_feeder <communicator address and port>

Or,

  Communication: results_retriever <feeder URL> <results file path>
  Communication: communicator <results file path>

Additionally,
    Calculation: order_receptor <listen port> <orderer address> <order file path>
    Calculation: calculator <order file path>
