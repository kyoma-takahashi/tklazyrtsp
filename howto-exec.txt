On cmd on Communication host,

start \
results_receptor <listen port> <results_feeder address> \
| results_cacher <results_temp path> \
2> log

(communicator <results_temp path> | tee.exe log) 3>&2 2>&1 1>&3 \
| tee2process.rb \
"source_feeder <source_receptor address and port>" \
| decoder \
> source_dump 2> log

tee.exe is in msys. Alternative: tee.bat in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10711839/using-a-custom-tee-command-for-bat-file/10719322#10719322
tee2process.rb "..." cannot be replaced by bash -c "tee >(source_feeder ...)"

On cmd on Calculation host,

source_receptor <listen port> <source_feeder address> \
| decoder \
| calculation_coordinator \
| tee2process.rb \
"results_summariser | results_feeder <results_receptor address and port>" \
"results_publisher <shared file path>" \
> results_dump 2> log

tee2process.rb "..." cannot be replaced by tee >(results_feeder ...) even on msys.

To feed results to communicator, there could be some alternative
implementations, but they are not so good.

The followings cannot be implemented since no fork.

  Communication: communicator <listen port> <results_feeder address>
    Calculation: results_feeder <communicator address and port>

The followings could be time consuming.

    Calculation: results_feeder <listen port> <communicator address>
  Communication: communicator <results_feeder URL>

Additionally,
    Calculation: order_receptor <listen port> <orderer address> <order file path>
    Calculation: calculator <order file path>
